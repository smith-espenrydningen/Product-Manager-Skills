## 📣 Updates & Announcements

### Feb 10, 2026 — v0.4 Facilitation Protocol Fix

We found and fixed a facilitation regression in interactive flows.

What happened:
- We expected guided, step-by-step facilitation with progressive context handling.
- In practice, a brevity-focused rewrite path stripped out parts of the original facilitation modality (especially the "walk through questions" behavior).

What we changed in v0.4:
- Standardized a canonical facilitation protocol in [`skills/workshop-facilitation/SKILL.md`](skills/workshop-facilitation/SKILL.md).
- Rolled that source-of-truth linkage across interactive skills and facilitation-heavy workflow skills.
- Added mandatory session heads-up, `Context dump` bypass, and `Best guess` mode.
- Added stronger progress labels, interruption handling, and decision-point recommendation rules.

Credit:
- Codex identified the protocol mismatch and implemented the fix across the repo.

Announcement draft: [`docs/announcements/2026-02-10-v0-4-facilitation-fix.md`](docs/announcements/2026-02-10-v0-4-facilitation-fix.md)

### Feb 8, 2026 — LinkedIn Launch

**Post title:** Product Management Skills for Your Agents  
**Subtitle:** Because "just prompt better" is not a strategy.

Still rewriting PM prompts and getting generic AI output? I built a reusable PM Skills repo to help you make sharper decisions, docs, and outcomes faster.

- Full announcement draft: [`docs/announcements/2026-02-08-linkedin-launch.md`](docs/announcements/2026-02-08-linkedin-launch.md)
- Substack article draft: [`docs/announcements/2026-02-08-substack-savage-launch.md`](docs/announcements/2026-02-08-substack-savage-launch.md)
- Announcements index: [`docs/announcements/README.md`](docs/announcements/README.md)
- Skills repo: [Product Manager Skills](https://github.com/deanpeters/Product-Manager-Skills)
- Prior prompts repo: [Product Manager Prompts](https://github.com/deanpeters/product-manager-prompts)

## 🎯 What This Is

**42 ready-to-use PM frameworks** that teach AI agents how to do product management work professionally—without you having to explain your process every time.

Instead of saying *"Write a PRD"* and hoping for the best, the agent already knows:
- ✅ How to structure a PRD
- ✅ What questions to ask stakeholders
- ✅ Which prioritization framework to use (and when)
- ✅ How to run customer discovery interviews
- ✅ How to break down epics using proven patterns

**Result:** You work faster, with better consistency, at a higher strategic level.

**Works with:** Claude Code, Cowork, OpenAI Codex, ChatGPT, Gemini, and any AI agent that can read structured knowledge.

---

## ✅ Safety and Evaluation

Before using any skill:
- Review the skill file and any linked resources. If it includes `scripts/`, read them before running.
- Prefer least privilege. Skills should not require secrets or network access unless explicitly documented.
- Do a quick dry run with a realistic prompt, then refine `name` and `description` for better discoverability.

---

## 🧰 Optional Scripts (Deterministic Helpers)

Some skills include a `scripts/` folder with deterministic helpers for calculations or formatting. These are optional, should be audited before running, and should avoid network calls or external dependencies.

**Examples:**
- `skills/tam-sam-som-calculator/scripts/market-sizing.py`
- `skills/user-story/scripts/user-story-template.py`

---

## 🤖 Skill Creation Utility

**Want to create your own skills?** Choose one of these utilities:

- `scripts/add-a-skill.sh` - Content-first, AI-assisted generation from notes/frameworks.
- `scripts/build-a-skill.sh` - Guided "build-a-bear" wizard that prompts section-by-section.
- `scripts/find-a-skill.sh` - Search skills by name/type/keyword with ranked results.
- `scripts/test-a-skill.sh` - Run strict conformance checks and optional smoke checks.
- `scripts/zip-a-skill.sh` - Build upload-ready `.zip` files by skill, type, or all skills.

**What it does:**
1. Analyzes your content and suggests skill types
2. Generates complete skill files with examples
3. Validates metadata for marketplace compliance
4. Updates documentation automatically

**Usage:**
```bash
# From a file
./scripts/add-a-skill.sh research/your-framework.md

# Guided wizard
./scripts/build-a-skill.sh

# Find a skill
./scripts/find-a-skill.sh --keyword pricing --type interactive

## ✅ Claude Web Upload Checklist

- Keep frontmatter `name` <= 64 chars and `description` <= 200 chars.
- Ensure the skill folder name matches the `name` value.
- Use `scripts/zip-a-skill.sh --skill <skill-name>` (or `--type component`, `--preset core-pm`) to generate upload-ready ZIPs.
- (Advanced) Use `scripts/package-claude-skills.sh` if you need unpacked upload-ready folders.
- Validate metadata with `scripts/check-skill-metadata.py`.
- For GitHub ZIP upload flow, see [`docs/Using PM Skills with Claude.md`](docs/Using%20PM%20Skills%20with%20Claude.md#github-zip-install).

## 🏗️ Three-Tier Architecture (How Skills Work Together)

These 42 skills are organized into **three types** that build on each other:

```text
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  WORKFLOW SKILLS (5)                                      │
│  Complete end-to-end PM processes                         │
│  Example: "Run a product strategy session"                │
│  Timeline: 2-4 weeks                                      │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓ orchestrates
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  INTERACTIVE SKILLS (18)                                  │
│  Guided discovery with adaptive questions                 │
│  Example: "Which prioritization framework should I use?"  │
│  Timeline: 30-90 minutes                                  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                         ↓ uses
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  COMPONENT SKILLS (19)                                    │
│  Templates for specific PM deliverables                   │
│  Example: "Write a user story"                            │
│  Timeline: 10-30 minutes                                  │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Component Skills (19) — Templates & Artifacts
**What:** Reusable templates for creating specific PM deliverables (user stories, positioning statements, epics, personas, PRDs, etc.)

**When to use:** You need a standard template or format for a specific deliverable.

**Example:** "Write a user story with acceptance criteria" → Use [`user-story.md`](skills/user-story/SKILL.md)

---

### Interactive Skills (18) — Guided Discovery
**What:** Multi-turn conversational flows where AI asks you 3-5 adaptive questions, then offers smart recommendations based on your context.

**When to use:** You need help deciding which approach to take or gathering context before executing.

**Example:** "Which prioritization framework should I use?" → Run [`prioritization-advisor.md`](skills/prioritization-advisor/SKILL.md), which asks about your product stage, team size, data availability, then recommends RICE, ICE, Kano, or other frameworks.

**How they work:**
1. AI asks 3-5 questions about your context
2. You answer (or pick from numbered options)
3. AI offers 3-5 tailored recommendations
4. You choose one (or combine approaches)
5. AI executes using the right component skills

---

### Workflow Skills (5) — End-to-End Processes
**What:** Complete PM processes that orchestrate multiple component and interactive skills over days/weeks.

**When to use:** You need to run a full PM workflow from start to finish (strategy session, discovery cycle, roadmap planning, PRD creation).

**Example:** "Align stakeholders on product strategy" → Run [`product-strategy-session.md`](skills/product-strategy-session/SKILL.md), which guides you through positioning → problem framing → solution exploration → roadmap planning over 2-4 weeks.

## 💡 Why Skills Beat Prompts

| Prompts | Skills |
|---------|--------|
| One-time instructions per task | Reusable frameworks learned once |
| "Write a PRD for X" | Agent knows PRD structure, asks smart questions, handles edge cases |
| You repeat yourself constantly | Agent remembers best practices |
| Inconsistent outputs | Consistent, professional results |

**Skills = Less explaining, more strategic work.**

## 🎓 Philosophy

**Principles:**
- **Outcome-driven** over output-driven (solve problems, don't just ship features)
- **Evidence over vibes** (validate with data, not opinions)
- **Clarity beats completeness** (simple and usable beats comprehensive and confusing)
- **Examples beat explanations** (show, don't just tell)

**No hype. No buzzwords. Just frameworks that work.**

**v0.4 — February 10, 2026**

Highlights in this release:
- Fixed a facilitation protocol regression where brevity-focused rewrites could remove expected guided-question behavior
